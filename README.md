Have your computer do something with DTMF via telephone or ham radio

I have the DTMF Executer to read emails, read mIRC logs and other stuff.
You will want to edit dtmfexec.bat file to customize commands. The batch
file is executed everytime # button is pushed. The command number can be
resetted by pressing *
